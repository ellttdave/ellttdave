David Elliott / ellttdave | Product & Platform Strategy

My career is defined by successfully scaling complex platform technologies and transforming business challenges into enterprise-grade SaaS solutions. With over 16 years of experience, I specialize in the architecture, deployment, and management of systems that handle immense scale, operate under stringent regulatory demands, and process over $1+ billion annually.
I thrive at the intersection of sophisticated technology and user-centric design, having solved real-time complexity challenges across thousands of unique enterprise configurations. This has instilled in me a deep commitment to not just building features, but architecting innovative underlying systems that ensure long-term, sustainable product success.
My focus is on three core pillars:
	1	Platform Mastery: Architecting highly reliable, compliant, and scalable back-end services.
	2	Product Leadership: Defining clear visions and driving cross-functional teams to launch successful enterprise products.
	3	Talent Development: Building and mentoring high-performing teams, resulting in multiple direct reports advancing to senior leadership roles.

Showcase Project: Next-Generation Performance Intelligence

To demonstrate my expertise in leveraging cutting-edge technology to solve complex data challenges, I have developed the Data Insights Dashboard—an AI-powered platform for performance analysis and clinical decision support.
This showcase project is a direct application of my professional experience, proving my ability to:
	•	Integrate Multi-Modal Data: Harmonize disparate, structured performance data with extensive knowledge bases to form a comprehensive single source of truth.
	•	Apply AI for Clinical Insight: Deliver evidence-based reports and personalized recommendations by combining rigorous clinical standards with advanced machine learning models.
	•	Drive Outcome-Based Strategy: Focus the product vision on actionable results, such as reducing injury risk and enhancing clinical decision-making for sports medicine professionals.
This project underscores my capability to lead a product from concept through detailed requirements to a demonstrable, architecturally sound solution ready to meet the demands of any performance-critical environment. I am actively seeking a role where I can apply my platform scaling expertise to drive your next wave of product innovation.
